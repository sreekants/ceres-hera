# Ceres (Hera-Release)
This is a demo package of the Hera release of the [Ceres farm operating system](https://www.openhub.net/p/ceres-os). 

The Ceres project is an exploratory experiment to figure out a low-cost turnkey infrastructure on a national scale can avert the scourge of climate change in the poorest of countries around the world. Although this is an Indian story, there is a resonance of the same challenges across Equatorial & Sub-Saharan Africa, South-Asia, Latin America & South East Asia.

## Introduction
The Hera release is an exploratory experiment to figure out what kind of a low-cost IoT infrastructure is required to delopy AI-based precision farming across farms in emerging countries. The experiments in architecture, platforms & technologies here, are the intial steps toward a highly distributed, remotely deployable IoT hosted operating system running on a broad set of real-time OS (including Arduino, RTOS, Windows-Embedded & Linux), operating in devices spread across farms in the emerging countries.

## Objective
Hera is a feasibility study for Zeus, that answers the following questions:
* Is it possible to automate a remote rural farm entirely using IoT?
* It it possible to remotely administer, upgrade and reprovision it entirely through mobile phone or internet?
* Is it possible to automate a farm at $0.1/sqft?

## Conclusions
We are now optimistic that the objectives can be achieved. However, we will need to significantly modify our original architecture.

## Status
### Phase 1 - Hera Release: Technology Evaluation (Aug-Oct 2017)

*Status - Architecture unsatisfactory. (as of Oct 12, 2017)*

A prototypical version of Hera has been developed as part of Ceres (version 0.3). This however has not achieved our design goals. The implementation of Ceres on ESP8266, our target platform needs to be significantly optimized. Memory limitations on the ESP8266 significantly curtails the implementation of our solution. We are looking into topograpical, architectural and/or platform (move to ESP32) changes to work around the limitations. 

Hera now involves over 120k LOC. As such, the current image is unstable because it uses 78% of the global memory. The Hera version will need to be trimmed down by another 20% for it to be considered stable. The next version of the software, available by Jan 2018 will be a significantly slimmed down version of this operating system.

We are abandoning our current design and going back to the drawing board. 

### Phase 2 - Zeus Release: Hera Re-Implementation (Jan-Apr 2018)

*Status - Unplanned (as of Oct 12, 2017)* 

The focus will be on the rearchitecture of Hera, for a lean, stable and scalable version of the operating system, ready for pilot deployment in up to 50 farms across India by Q3'18.
